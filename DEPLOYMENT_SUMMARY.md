- Provides success/failure summary
- Stores reasoning in database

**Usage:**
```bash

# Run as afternoon session
python scripts/manual_trading_session.py --job-name afternoon_research
```

### 3. Manual Trading Quick Launcher

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed: MarketDataService Initialization
**File:** `backend/main.py` (line 47)

**Issue:** `MarketDataService` was being initialized without required `db` parameter

**Fix:**
```python
# Before:
market_data = MarketDataService()

# After:
db = SessionLocal()
market_data = MarketDataService(db)
```

**Impact:** Backend now starts successfully with scheduler enabled

## Cost Estimate

**1-Week Test:**
- Research: ~$0.18 (with caching)
- Trading: ~$0.80
- **Total: ~$1.00**

**Monthly (if continued):**
- Research: ~$0.72
- Trading: ~$3.20
- **Total: ~$3.92**

## Support

**If issues occur:**
1. Check DEPLOYMENT_LOCAL.md troubleshooting section
2. Review backend console logs
3. Verify API keys in `.env` file
